The world is full of beauty,
In every shape and form,
From the mountains to the valleys,
To the calm before the storm.

The sunsets painted with colors,
The stars that light the sky,
The breeze that gently whispers,
And the ocean's endless sigh.

Nature's poetry surrounds us,
In every living thing,
A symphony of life and love,
A never-ending ring.

So let us stop and listen,
To the magic that's around,
For every day is precious,
And every sound profound.
